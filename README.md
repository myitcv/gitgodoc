## `gitgodoc` - a simple git branch-based wrapper around godoc

Very much WIP

```
Usage of ./gitgodoc:
  -gopath string
        a relative GOPATH that will be used when running the godoc server (prepended with the repo dir)
  -pkg string
        the package the repo represents
  -repo string
        git url from which to clone
  -serveFrom string
        directory to use as a working directory
```
